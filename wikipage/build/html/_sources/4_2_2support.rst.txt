Read outputs
========================================

The different output file formats enabled in OpenWQ are all fairly well established in the scientific community: `CSV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_, `HDF5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format>`_, and `VTU <https://people.math.sc.edu/Burkardt/data/vtu/vtu.html>`_.
Widely used programming languages such as C++, R, Python and MATLAB have support for reading, editing and creating such files.

However, we developed a suite of supporting scripts specifically tailored to read OpenWQ's outputs.
Check them `here <https://openwq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/4_2_2support_scripts>`_.
