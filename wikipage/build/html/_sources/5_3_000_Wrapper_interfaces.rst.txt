Language binding
====================================

If your hydro-model is written in a language other than C or C++, you'll need to use ``wrapper libraries``.

What is binding?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Binding generally refers to a mapping of one thing to another.
In the context of software libraries, bindings are wrapper libraries that bridge two programming languages, so that a library written for one language can be used in another language.
