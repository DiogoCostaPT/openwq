Motivation & Innovation
==================================

OpenWQ aims to address three main challenges with the current state of water quality modelling:

* ``Structural rigidity`` that hinders flexible integration of new methods and concepts from complementary disciplines and experts (e.g., limnology, soil science, biogeochemistry) for meaninful and impactful collaborative work. The static structure of existing models also limits their suitability for a wide change of environmental problems
* ``Hydro-flux calculations`` embedded in water quality modelling tools are often outdated, or limited, when compared to dedicated, disciplinary hydro-models (e.g., hydrologiocal or hydrodynamic modelling tools)
* ``Uncertainty`` in model structure, process representation, and future scenarios (e.g., climate change) cannot be properly addressed because the current models are not suitable for adequate testing of modelling hypothesis

Structural rigidity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Water quality models have improved significantly over the last decades. There are more water quality models now than ever before, many of them quite well established.
However, there a common issue with most of these models.
