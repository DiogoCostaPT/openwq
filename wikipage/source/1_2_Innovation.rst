Motivation & Innovation
==================================

openWQ aims to enable a more flexible representation of local and global nuances in terrestrial biogeochemical cycling across regions, climate zones, and aquatic ecosystems through an adaptative reaction-network design. This concept was developed based on 10 years of experience with the development of hydro-biogeochemical models at ECCCâ€™s Research Branch and the UofS.

OpenWQ addresses three main challenges with existing biogeochemical and water quality models:

* ``Structural rigidity`` that hinder the effective use of models across landscapes and in complex, diverse environments (permafrost, peatlands, variable contributing areas) that require more investigative, open-ended, and interactive simulation approaches;
* ``Hydro-flux calculations`` embedded in these modelling tools are often outdated, or limited, when compared to dedicated, disciplinary hydro-models (e.g., hydrologiocal or hydrodynamic modelling tools); and
* ``Uncertainty`` in model structure, process representation, and future scenarios (e.g., climate change) cannot be properly addressed because the current models are not suitable for adequate testing of modelling hypothesis.

    Water quality models have improved significantly over the last decades. There are more water quality models now than ever before, many of them quite well established.
    However, there a common issue with most of these models.
