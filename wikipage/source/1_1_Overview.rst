Overview
==================================

OpenWQ is a multi-scale, multi-chemistry modelling framework.
It aims to be fast, free, and extendable.

OpenWQ was specifically designed to promote flexible collaboration between modellers, scientists and stakeholders in the design and implementation of biogeochemical reaction networks (easily customizable via `rich JSON-based files <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#:~:text=JSON%20(JavaScript%20Object%20Notation%2C%20pronounced,(or%20other%20serializable%20values).>`_) in existing hydrological, hydrodynamic and groundwater models (1D to 3D models). The model is written in C++ and benefits from the powerful Armadillo template-based \CC library for linear algebra  `(Sanderson and Curtin, 2016) <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00026>`_ that enables the use of modern, flexible, efficient and compact data structures.

The OpenWQ system stems from previous models developed by `Environment and Climate Change Canada <https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html>`_ and the `University of Saskatchewan <https://www.usask.ca/>`_, particularly `CRHM-WQ <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169421009513>`_ (Cold Regions Hydrological Model - Water Quality) that extends the original `CRHM platform <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.6787>`_ (hydrology) model to nitrogen and phosphorus simulations, the `WINTRA <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.11346>`_ framework, the multiphase multilayer `PULSE <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309170818300095>`_ snow hydrochemistry model, and the `FLUXOS-OVERLAND <agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020WR027984>`_ model for watershed hydrodynamic-water quality simulations suitable for Prairie regions.

Our vision is to provide a multi-scale, multi-chemistry OpenWQ modelling framework suitable for flexible hypothesis testing. OpenWQ does not run standalone. It runs coupled to existing hydro-models, which makes it ideal for scientists and engineers that want to enable biogeochemical modelling capabilities in their prefered modelling systems.

The model is currently being coupled to `CRHM <https://research-groups.usask.ca/hydrology/modelling/crhm.php>`_, `SUMMA <https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/summa>`_ and `MESH <https://research-groups.usask.ca/hydrology/modelling/mesh.php>`_. See [PLACEHOLDER for link to coupler page]
