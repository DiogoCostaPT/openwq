Welcome to OpenWQ's documentation!
==================================

OpenWQ is a generalised reaction-network model written in C++.
It was designed as a coupler that can be linked to existing hydro-models to enable flexible, multi-chemistry biogeochemical simulations.
It aims to be fast, free, and extendable.
