Welcome to OpenWQ's documentation!
==================================

OpenWQ is a generalised biogeochemical reaction-network model written in C++.
It was designed as a coupler for integration with existing hydro-models to enable flexible, multi-scale, multi-chemistry simulations.
OpenWQ adapts to the host hydro-model spatial and temporal configurations, which can include 1D, 2D or 3D spatial discretizations based on structured or unstructured meshes.
It aims to be flexible, fast, free, and extendable.
